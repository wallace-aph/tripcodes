# tripcodes

A list of tripcodes mined on a VPS with a 200,000 word regex dictionary. All words are either all capital or lowercase and followed or preceded by punctuation. 2.91M tripcode are generated a second, with a match being found every 13.9 seconds on average. This equals about 5,000 per day. Below is a sample of tripcodes mined:

!/91/evicts

!dooley.org

!B3t.WHISKY

!USS/INSANE

!BBB/LAMBDA

!PASTIES/qA

!.FiG/ASUKA

!SVs.EMILIA

!Not.fawkes

!JSN/ORGASM

!OTK.LUANDA

!F.m.thefts

If you want one of the tripcodes listed in the database, let me know, and I'll give it to you provided nobody else (or myself) took it first. At some point I might upload the master list with all the passwords, but right now it's on a first-come first-serve basis.
